# **Customer Demographics and Purchase Behavior Analysis**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes customer demographics and purchase behavior using a retail dataset. The objective is to explore how factors such as age, income, gender, and loyalty status influence purchasing patterns. Key statistical methods and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to uncover meaningful insights.

## **Key Features**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for continuous variables like income and purchase amount.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Conducted Pearson and Spearman correlations to explore relationships between variables.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: 
   - T-test to compare purchase behavior across genders.
   - Chi-square test to assess the relationship between gender and loyalty status.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Used Z-scores to identify customers with extreme purchase behaviors.
6. **Linear Regression**: Built a simple linear regression model to predict purchase amounts based on income.

## **Tools and Libraries Used**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SciPy**: For performing statistical tests such as t-tests and chi-square tests.
- **Statsmodels**: For hypothesis testing and statistical models.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building a linear regression model.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical data visualization.

## **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Dealt with missing data and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized the distribution of key variables.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Applied correlation, t-tests, chi-square, and regression to uncover relationships and patterns in the data.
4. **Modeling**: Developed a simple linear regression model to predict purchase amounts.
5. **Results and Insights**:
   - Found a strong positive correlation between income and purchase amounts.
   - No significant difference in purchase behavior between male and female customers.
   - Identified outliers with unusually high purchase amounts.

## **Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the use of EDA and statistical techniques to gain actionable insights into customer behavior. The results offer valuable insights for retail decision-making, such as focusing on high-income customers for targeted marketing campaigns.
